# Bug Report

Bug reports are categorized in the following manner:

- P1: Feature is unusable
- P2: Feature works, but requires workaround/hack
- P3: Not critical, but needs fixed ASAP
- P4: Nice to have, but not priority

These should be worked in priority order.

## P1

### Shortlink expiration admin form does not submit

- The form will not submit regardless of the options selected.

### Entity shortlink tab on the entity form (i.e. Node edit form)

- The 'Copy' text does not copy link to the clipboard
- The shortlink display that is linked should open in a new window so the user does not navigate away from the edit form.
