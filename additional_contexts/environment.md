# Operating Environment

This is a stand-along module and drush commands should not be run within this project because there is not a Drupal site.
However, for Drupal core code and API's can be accessed in another project that has a compatible version of Drupal 11.x installed.

## Drupal Core Paths

- Drupal 11.x: /home/ronald/PhpstormProjects/drupalodyssey/web/core
- Drupal 10.x: /home/ronald/PhpstormProjects/drupal-demo-site/web/core

Do not modify any files in these paths; they are for reference only.
